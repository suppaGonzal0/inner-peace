Kick your feet back into a push up position and lower your body so that your chest touches the floor. Jump and return your feet to the squat position as fast as possible.

    { "Name": "Pull ups", "how": "Start by hanging from a pull up bar with your palms facing away from you. Keeping your chest up and your shoulders back, squeeze your glutes and cross your feet, then pull yourself up so that your chin rests over the bar. Lower back down with control." },
    { "Name": "Push ups", "how": "Start in a plank position, with your shoulders directly over your hands.
