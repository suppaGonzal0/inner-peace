            <p>The paleo diet advocates eating the same foods that your hunter-gatherer ancestors allegedly ate.</p>

            <br />
            
            <p>It’s based on the theory that modern diseases are linked to the Western diet, as proponents
            believe that the human body hasn’t evolved to process legumes, grains, and dairy.</p>

            <br />
            
            <h3>How it works:</h3>
            <p>The paleo diet advocates eating whole foods, fruits, vegetables, lean meats, nuts,
            and seeds. It restricts the consumption of processed foods, grains, sugar, and dairy,
            though some less restrictive versions allow for some dairy products like cheese.</p>

            <br />
            
            <h3>Weight loss: </h3>
            <p>Numerous studies have shown that the paleo diet
            can aid weight loss and reduce harmful belly fat.</p>

            <br />
            
            <p>For example, in one 3-week study, 14 healthy adults following
            a paleo diet lost an average of 5.1 pounds (2.3 kg) and reduced their
            waist circumference — a marker for belly fat — by an average of 0.6 inches (1.5 cm).</p>

            <br />
            
            <p>Research also suggests that the paleo diet may be more filling than popular diets like
            the Mediterranean diet and low-fat diets. This may be due to its high protein content.</p>

            <br />
            
            <h3>Other benefits:</h3>
            <p>Following the paleo diet may reduce several heart disease risk factors,
            such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.</p>

            <br />
            
            <h3>Downsides:</h3>
            <p>Though the paleo diet is healthy, it restricts several nutritious 
            food groups, including legumes, whole grains, and dairy.</p>
