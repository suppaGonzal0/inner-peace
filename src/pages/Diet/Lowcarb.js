            <p>Low-carb diets are among the most popular diets for weight loss. Examples include the Atkins diet,
                ketogenic (keto) diet, and low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet.</p>

            <br />

            <p>Some varieties reduce carbs more drastically than others. For instance, very-low-carb
                diets like theketo diet restrict this macronutrient to under 10% of total calories,
                compared with 30% or less for other types.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>How it works:</h3>
            <p>Low-carb diets restrict your carb intake in favor of protein and fat.
                They’re typically higher in protein than low-fat diets, which is important,
                as protein can help curb your appetite, raise your metabolism, and conserve muscle mass.</p>

            <br />

            <p>In very-low-carb diets like keto, your body begins using fatty acids rather than
                carbs for energy by converting them into ketones. This process is called ketosis.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Weight loss:</h3>
            <p>Many studies indicate that low-carb diets can aid weight loss
                and may be more effective than conventional low-fat diet.</p>

            <br />

            <p>For example, a review of 53 studies including 68,128 participants found that
                low-carb diets resulted in significantly more weight loss than low-fat diets.
                What’s more, low-carb diets appear to be quite effective at burning harmful belly fat.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Other benefits:</h3>
            <p>Research suggests that low-carb diets may reduce risk factors for heart disease,
                including high cholesterol and blood pressure levels. They may also improve
                blood sugar and insulin levels in people with type 2 diabetes.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Downsides:</h3>
            <p>In some cases, a low-carb diet may raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Very-low-carb
                diets can also be difficult to follow and cause digestive upset in some people.
                In very rare situations, following a very-low-carb diet may cause a condition known
                as ketoacidosis, a dangerous metabolic condition that can be fatal if left untreated</p>
