            <p>The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that people in countries like Italy and Greece used to eat.
                Though it was designed to lower heart disease risk, numerous studies indicate that it can also aid weight loss.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>How it works:</h3>
            <p>The Mediterranean diet advocates eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, nuts,
            seeds, legumes, tubers, whole grains, fish, seafood, and extra virgin olive oil.</p>

            <br />

            <p>Foods such as poultry, eggs, and dairy products are to be eaten in moderation. Meanwhile, red meats are limited.
            Additionally, the Mediterranean diet restricts refined grains, trans fats, processed meats, added sugar, and other highly processed foods.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Weight loss:</h3>
            <p>Though itâ€™s not specifically a weight loss diet, many studies show
            that adopting a Mediterranean-style diet may aid weight loss.</p>

            <br />

            <p>For example, an analysis of 19 studies found that people who combined
            the Mediterranean diet with exercise or calorie restriction lost an
            average of 8.8 pounds (4 kg) more than those on a control diet.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Other benefits:</h3>
            <p>The Mediterranean diet encourages eating plenty of antioxidant-rich foods, 
            which may help combat inflammation and oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals.
            It has been linked to reduced risks of heart disease and premature death.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Downsides:</h3>
            <p>As the Mediterranean diet is not strictly a weight loss diet, people may
            not lose weight following it unless they also consume fewer calories.</p>
