            <p>WW, formerly Weight Watchers, is one of the most popular weight loss programs worldwide.</p>
            
            <br />

            <p>While it doesn’t restrict any food groups, people on a WW plan must eat
            within their set daily points to reach their ideal weight.</p>
            
            <br />

            <h3>How it works:</h3>
            <p>WW is a points-based system that assigns different foods and
            beverages a value, depending on their calorie, fat, and fiber contents.</p>
            
            <br />

            <p>To reach your desired weight, you must stay within your daily point allowance.</p>
            
            <br />

            <h3>Weight loss:</h3>
            <p>Many studies show that the WW program can help you lose weight.</p>
            
            <br />

            <p>For example, a review of 45 studies found that people who followed a WW
            diet lost 2.6% more weight than people who received standard counseling.</p>
            
            <br />

            <p>What’s more, people who follow WW programs have been shown to be more successful
            at maintaining weight loss after several years, compared with those who follow other diets.</p>
            
            <br />

            <h3>Other benefits:</h3>
            <p>WW allows flexibility, making it easy to follow. This enables people with
            dietary restrictions, such as those with food allergies, to adhere to the plan.</p>
            
            <br />

            <h3>Downsides:</h3>
            <p>While it allows for flexibility, WW can be costly depending on the subscription
            plan. Also, it’s flexibility can be a downfall if dieters choose unhealthy foods.</p>
