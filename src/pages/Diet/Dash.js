            <p>Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH diet, is an eating plan that is designed
            to help treat or prevent high blood pressure, which is clinically known as hypertension.</p>

            <br />

            <p>It emphasizes eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
            and lean meats and is low in salt, red meat, added sugars, and fat.</p>

            <br />

            <p>While the DASH diet is not a weight loss diet, many people report losing weight on it.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>How it works:</h3>
            <p>The DASH diet recommends specific servings of different food groups.
            The number of servings you are allowed to eat depends on your daily calorie intake.</p>

            <br />

            <p>For example, an average person on the DASH diet would eat about 5
            servings of vegetables, 5 servings of fruit, 7 servings of healthy
            carbs like whole grains, 2 servings of low-fat dairy products,
            and 2 servings or fewer of lean meats per day.
            In addition, you’re allowed to eat nuts and seeds 2–3 times per week.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Weight loss:</h3>
            <p>Studies show that the DASH diet can help you lose weight.
            For example, an analysis of 13 studies found that people on
            the DASH diet lost significantly more weight over 8–24 weeks than people on a control diet.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Other benefits:</h3>
            <p>The DASH diet has been shown to reduce blood pressure levels and
            several heart disease risk factors. Also, it may help combat recurrent
            depressive symptoms and lower your risk of breast and colorectal cancer.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Downsides:</h3>
            <p>While the DASH diet may aid weight loss, there is mixed evidence
            on salt intake and blood pressure. In addition, eating too little
            salt has been linked to increased insulin resistance and an
            increased risk of death in people with heart failure.</p>
