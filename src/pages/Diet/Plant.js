            <p>Plant-based diets may help you lose weight. Vegetarianism and veganism are the most popular
                versions, which restrict animal products for health, ethical, and environmental reasons. However,
                more flexible plant-based diets also exist, such as the flexitarian diet, which
                is a plant-based diet that allows eating animal products in moderation.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>How it works:</h3>
            <p>There are many types of vegetarianism, but most involve eliminating all meat, poultry,
                and fish. Some vegetarians may likewise avoid eggs and dairy.</p>

            <br />

            <p>The vegan diet takes it a step further by restricting all animal products, as well as
                animal-derived products like dairy, gelatin, honey, whey, casein, and albumin.</p>

                <br />

            <p>There are no clear-cut rules for the flexitarian diet, as itâ€™s a lifestyle change rather
                than a diet. It encourages eating mostly fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains but
                allows for protein and animal products in moderation, making it a popular alternative.</p>

                <br />

            <p>Many of the restricted food groups are high in calories, so limiting them may aid weight loss.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Weight loss:</h3>
            <p>Research shows that plant-based diets are effective for weight loss.</p>

            <br />

            <p>A review of 12 studies including 1,151 participants found that
                people on a plant-based diet lost an average of 4.4 pounds (2 kg)
                more than those who included animal products.</p>

            <br />

            <p>Plus, those following a vegan diet lost an average of 5.5 pounds
                (2.5 kg) more than people not eating a plant-based diet. Plant-based diets likely
                aid weight loss because they tend to be rich in fiber, which can help you
                stayfuller for longer,and low in high-calorie fat.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Other benefits:</h3>
            <p>Plant-based diets have been linked to many other benefits, such as a reduced
            risk of chronic conditions like heart disease, certain cancers, and diabetes.
            They can also be more environmentally sustainable than meat-based diets.</p>
