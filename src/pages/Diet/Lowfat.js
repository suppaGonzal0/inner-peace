            <p>Like low-carb diets, low-fat diets have been popular for decades.
            In general, a low-fat diet involves restricting your fat intake to 30% of your daily calories.</p>

            <br />
            
            <p>Some very- and ultra-low-fat diets aim to limit fat consumption to under 10% of calories.</p>

            <br />
          
            <h3>How it works:</h3>
            <p>Low-fat diets restrict fat intake because fat provides about twice the number of
            calories per gram, compared with the other two macronutrients — protein and carbs.</p>

            <br />
          
            <p>Ultra-low-fat diets contain fewer than 10% of calories from fat,
            with approximately 80% of calories coming from carbs and 10% from protein.
            Ultra-low-fat diets are mainly plant-based and limit meat and animal products.</p>

            <br />
          
            <h3>Weight loss:</h3>
            <p>As low-fat diets restrict calorie intake, they can aid weight loss.
            An analysis of 33 studies including over 73,500 participants found that
            following a low-fat diet led to small but relevant changes in weight and waist circumference.</p>

            <br />
          
            <p>However, while low-fat diets appear to be as effective as low-carb diets for weight
            loss in controlled situations, low-carb diets seem to be more effective day to day.</p>

            <br />
          
            <p>Ultra-low-fat diets have been shown to be successful, especially among people with
            obesity. For example, an 8-week study in 56 participants found that eating a diet
            comprising 7–14% fat led to an average weight loss of 14.8 pounds (6.7 kg).</p>

            <br />
          
            <h3>Other benefits:</h3>
            <p>Low-fat diets have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and 
            stroke. They may also reduce inflammation and improve markers of diabetes.</p>

            <br />
          
            <h3>Downsides:</h3>
            <p>Restricting fat too much can lead to health problems in the long term,
            as fat plays a key role in hormone production, nutrient absorption, and cell
            health. Moreover, very-low-fat diets have been linked to a higher risk of metabolic syndrome.</p>
